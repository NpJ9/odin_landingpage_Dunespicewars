        <p class = "headertext2">The stellar reputation of House Atreides owes a lot to its leader’s commanding style: firm yet honorable and fair. By imperial decree, the Atreides have just inherited the stewardship of Arrakis and have a lot of work to do to take over from the Harkonnens.</p>

    <p class = "headertext">House Harkonnen shares its chilling reputation with its leader, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. They have been called despotic, merciless, scheming and devious. And those are only their finer qualities.</p>

    <p class = "headertext">The Smugglers in Dune: Spice Wars rely on turning their rivals' prosperity into their own. While they might not have the mightiest armies or votes in the Landsraad (at first, anyway), their unique power to skim off of other players' economies helps them keep up and eventually outpace their competitors.</p>
